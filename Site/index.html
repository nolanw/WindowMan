        WindowMan helps you arrange the windows on your displays. You pick a keyboard shortcut or hotkey, then assign it to an action like "become as tall as the screen". As long as WindowMan is enabled, any resizable window can instantly become as tall as the screen. Just press your keyboard shortcut.

        WindowMan also comes with a menu. From your menu bar, it summarizes the keyboard shortcuts you've set and the different arrangements WindowMan can provide. You can even try out a particular action without setting a keyboard shortcut, just to see what it does.

        <a href="http://code.google.com/p/shiftit/">Shift It</a> inspired me to make a free offering that does this with configurable keyboard shortcuts, and saved me a lot of time burrowing through various APIs. <a href="http://growl.info">Growl</a> suggested the design of the components (prefpane, menu, helper) of WindowMan. <a href="http://wafflesoftware.net/shortcut/">Shortcut Recorder</a> provided some fantastic signposts at the stumbling blocks of key codes and modifier flags.
